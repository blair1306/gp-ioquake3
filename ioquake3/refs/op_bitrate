<doc f='codebrowser/code/opusfile-0.8/include/opusfile.h' l='1586'>/**Computes the bitrate of the stream, or of an individual link in a
    (possibly-chained) Ogg Opus stream.
   The stream must be seekable to compute the bitrate.
   For unseekable streams, use op_bitrate_instant() to get periodic estimates.
   \warning If the Opus stream (or link) is concurrently multiplexed with other
    logical streams (e.g., video), this uses the size of the entire stream (or
    link) to compute the bitrate, not just the number of bytes in the first
    logical Opus stream.
   Returning the latter requires scanning the entire file, but this may be done
    by decoding the whole file and calling op_bitrate_instant() once at the
    end.
   Install a trivial decoding callback with op_set_decode_callback() if you
    wish to skip actual decoding during this process.
   \param _of The \c OggOpusFile from which to retrieve the bitrate.
   \param _li The index of the link whose bitrate should be computed.
              Use a negative number to get the bitrate of the whole stream.
   \return The bitrate on success, or a negative value on error.
   \retval #OP_EINVAL The stream was only partially open, the stream was not
                       seekable, or \a _li was larger than the number of
                       links.*/</doc>
