  We keep track of the starting and ending offsets, as well as the point we
   started searching from, so we know where to bisect.
  We also keep the serial number, so we can tell if the page belonged to the
   current link or not, as well as the granule position, to aid in estimating
   the start of the link.*/</doc>
