<doc f='codebrowser/code/libogg-1.3.2/src/framing.c' l='521'>/* This will flush remaining packets into a page (returning nonzero),
   even if there is not enough data to trigger a flush normally
   (undersized page). If there are no packets or partial packets to
   flush, ogg_stream_flush returns 0.  Note that ogg_stream_flush will
   try to flush a normal sized page like ogg_stream_pageout; a call to
   ogg_stream_flush does not guarantee that all packets have flushed.
   Only a return value of 0 from ogg_stream_flush indicates all packet
   data is flushed into pages.

   since ogg_stream_flush will flush the last page in a stream even if
   it&apos;s undersized, you almost certainly want to use ogg_stream_pageout
   (and *not* ogg_stream_flush) unless you specifically need to flush
   a page regardless of size in the middle of a stream. */</doc>
