   Returns true if inflate is currently at the end of a block generated by
   Z_SYNC_FLUSH or Z_FULL_FLUSH. This function is used by one PPP
   implementation to provide an additional safety check. PPP uses
   Z_SYNC_FLUSH but removes the length bytes of the resulting empty stored
   block. When decompressing, PPP checks that at the end of input packet,
   inflate is waiting for these length bytes.
