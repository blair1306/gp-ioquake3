You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity.
Pendulums always swing north / south on unrotated models.  Add an angles field to the model to allow rotation in other directions.
Pendulum frequency is a physical constant based on the length of the beam and gravity.
&quot;model2&quot;	.md3 model to also draw
&quot;speed&quot;		the number of degrees each way the pendulum swings, (30 default)
