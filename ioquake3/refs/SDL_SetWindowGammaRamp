 *  \brief Set the gamma ramp for a window.
 *
 *  \param window The window for which the gamma ramp should be set.
 *  \param red The translation table for the red channel, or NULL.
 *  \param green The translation table for the green channel, or NULL.
 *  \param blue The translation table for the blue channel, or NULL.
 *
 *  \return 0 on success, or -1 if gamma ramps are unsupported.
 *
 *  Set the gamma translation table for the red, green, and blue channels
 *  of the video hardware.  Each table is an array of 256 16-bit quantities,
 *  representing a mapping between the input and output for that channel.
 *  The input is the index into the array, and the output is the 16-bit
 *  gamma value at that index, scaled to the output color precision.
