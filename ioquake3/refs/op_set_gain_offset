<doc f='codebrowser/code/opusfile-0.8/include/opusfile.h' l='1828'>/**Sets the gain to be used for decoded output.
   By default, the gain in the header is applied with no additional offset.
   The total gain (including header gain and/or track gain, if applicable, and
    this offset), will be clamped to [-32768,32767]/256 dB.
   This is more than enough to saturate or underflow 16-bit PCM.
   \note The new gain will not be applied to any already buffered, decoded
    output.
   This means you cannot change it sample-by-sample, as at best it will be
    updated packet-by-packet.
   It is meant for setting a target volume level, rather than applying smooth
    fades, etc.
   \param _of             The \c OggOpusFile on which to set the gain offset.
   \param _gain_type      One of #OP_HEADER_GAIN, #OP_ALBUM_GAIN,
                           #OP_TRACK_GAIN, or #OP_ABSOLUTE_GAIN.
   \param _gain_offset_q8 The gain offset to apply, in 1/256ths of a dB.
   \return 0 on success or a negative value on error.
   \retval #OP_EINVAL The \a _gain_type was unrecognized.*/</doc>
