 *  This function initializes specific SDL subsystems

 *  Subsystem initialization is ref-counted, you must call
 *  SDL_QuitSubSystem for each SDL_InitSubSystem to correctly
 *  shutdown a subsystem manually (or call SDL_Quit to force shutdown).
 *  If a subsystem is already loaded then this call will
 *  increase the ref-count and return.
