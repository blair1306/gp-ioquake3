 *  \brief Get the size of a window&apos;s client area.
 *
 *  \param window   The window to query.
 *  \param w        Pointer to variable for storing the width, in screen
 *                  coordinates. May be NULL.
 *  \param h        Pointer to variable for storing the height, in screen
 *                  coordinates. May be NULL.
 *
 *  The window size in screen coordinates may differ from the size in pixels, if
 *  the window was created with SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI on a platform with
 *  high-dpi support (e.g. iOS or OS X). Use SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize() or
 *  SDL_GetRendererOutputSize() to get the real client area size in pixels.
