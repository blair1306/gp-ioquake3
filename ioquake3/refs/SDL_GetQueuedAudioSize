<doc f='include/SDL2/SDL_audio.h' l='519'>/**
 *  Get the number of bytes of still-queued audio.
 *
 *  This is the number of bytes that have been queued for playback with
 *  SDL_QueueAudio(), but have not yet been sent to the hardware.
 *
 *  Once we&apos;ve sent it to the hardware, this function can not decide the exact
 *  byte boundary of what has been played. It&apos;s possible that we just gave the
 *  hardware several kilobytes right before you called this function, but it
 *  hasn&apos;t played any of it yet, or maybe half of it, etc.
 *
 *  You may not queue audio on a device that is using an application-supplied
 *  callback; calling this function on such a device always returns 0.
 *  You have to use the audio callback or queue audio with SDL_QueueAudio(),
 *  but not both.
 *
 *  You should not call SDL_LockAudio() on the device before querying; SDL
 *  handles locking internally for this function.
 *
 *  \param dev The device ID of which we will query queued audio size.
 *  \return Number of bytes (not samples!) of queued audio.
 *
 *  \sa SDL_QueueAudio
 *  \sa SDL_ClearQueuedAudio
