<doc f='codebrowser/code/opusfile-0.8/include/opusfile.h' l='1608'>/**Compute the instantaneous bitrate, measured as the ratio of bits to playable
    samples decoded since a) the last call to op_bitrate_instant(), b) the last
    seek, or c) the start of playback, whichever was most recent.
   This will spike somewhat after a seek or at the start/end of a chain
    boundary, as pre-skip, pre-roll, and end-trimming causes samples to be
    decoded but not played.
   \param _of The \c OggOpusFile from which to retrieve the bitrate.
   \return The bitrate, in bits per second, or a negative value on error.
   \retval #OP_FALSE  No data has been decoded since any of the events
                       described above.
   \retval #OP_EINVAL The stream was only partially open.*/</doc>
