 *  \brief Capture the mouse, to track input outside an SDL window.
 *
 *  \param enabled Whether or not to enable capturing
 *
 *  Capturing enables your app to obtain mouse events globally, instead of
 *  just within your window. Not all video targets support this function.
 *  When capturing is enabled, the current window will get all mouse events,
 *  but unlike relative mode, no change is made to the cursor and it is
 *  not restrained to your window.
 *
 *  This function may also deny mouse input to other windows--both those in
 *  your application and others on the system--so you should use this
 *  function sparingly, and in small bursts. For example, you might want to
 *  track the mouse while the user is dragging something, until the user
 *  releases a mouse button. It is not recommended that you capture the mouse
 *  for long periods of time, such as the entire time your app is running.
 *
 *  While captured, mouse events still report coordinates relative to the
 *  current (foreground) window, but those coordinates may be outside the
 *  bounds of the window (including negative values). Capturing is only
 *  allowed for the foreground window. If the window loses focus while
 *  capturing, the capture will be disabled automatically.
 *
 *  While capturing is enabled, the current window will have the
 *  SDL_WINDOW_MOUSE_CAPTURE flag set.
 *
 *  \return 0 on success, or -1 if not supported.
