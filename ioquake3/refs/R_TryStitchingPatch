R_TryStitchPatch

This function will try to stitch patches in the same LoD group together for the highest LoD.

Only single missing vertice cracks will be fixed.

Vertices will be joined at the patch side a crack is first found, at the other side
of the patch (on the same row or column) the vertices will not be joined and cracks
might still appear at that side.
