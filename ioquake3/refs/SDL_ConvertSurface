 *  Creates a new surface of the specified format, and then copies and maps
 *  the given surface to it so the blit of the converted surface will be as
 *  fast as possible.  If this function fails, it returns NULL.

 *  The \c flags parameter is passed to SDL_CreateRGBSurface() and has those
 *  semantics.  You can also pass ::SDL_RLEACCEL in the flags parameter and
 *  SDL will try to RLE accelerate colorkey and alpha blits in the resulting
 *  surface.
