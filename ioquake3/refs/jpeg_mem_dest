 * Prepare for output to a memory buffer.
 * The caller may supply an own initial buffer with appropriate size.
 * Otherwise, or when the actual data output exceeds the given size,
 * the library adapts the buffer size as necessary.
 * The standard library functions malloc/free are used for allocating
 * larger memory, so the buffer is available to the application after
 * finishing compression, and then the application is responsible for
 * freeing the requested memory.
