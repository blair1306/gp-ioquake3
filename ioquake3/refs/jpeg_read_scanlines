 * Read some scanlines of data from the JPEG decompressor.
 *
 * The return value will be the number of lines actually read.
 * This may be less than the number requested in several cases,
 * including bottom of image, data source suspension, and operating
 * modes that emit multiple scanlines at a time.
 *
 * Note: we warn about excess calls to jpeg_read_scanlines() since
 * this likely signals an application programmer error.  However,
 * an oversize buffer (max_lines &gt; scanlines remaining) is not an error.
