 *  \brief Set the size of a window&apos;s client area.
 *
 *  \param window   The window to resize.
 *  \param w        The width of the window, in screen coordinates. Must be &gt;0.
 *  \param h        The height of the window, in screen coordinates. Must be &gt;0.
 *
 *  \note You can&apos;t change the size of a fullscreen window, it automatically
 *        matches the size of the display mode.
 *
 *  The window size in screen coordinates may differ from the size in pixels, if
 *  the window was created with SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI on a platform with
 *  high-dpi support (e.g. iOS or OS X). Use SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize() or
 *  SDL_GetRendererOutputSize() to get the real client area size in pixels.
