   symbol was encoded with.
  Exactly one call to ec_decode() must have been made so that all necessary
   intermediate calculations are performed.
  _fl:  The cumulative frequency of all symbols that come before the symbol
         decoded.
  _fh:  The cumulative frequency of all symbols up to and including the symbol
         decoded.
        Together with _fl, this defines the range [_fl,_fh) in which the value
         returned above must fall.
  _ft:  The total frequency of the symbols in the alphabet the symbol decoded
         was encoded in.
        This must be the same as passed to the preceding call to ec_decode().*/</doc>
