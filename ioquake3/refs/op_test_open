    the associated convenience functions.
   If this function fails, you are still responsible for freeing the
    \c OggOpusFile with op_free().
   \param _of The \c OggOpusFile to finish opening.
   \return 0 on success, or a negative value on error.
   \retval #OP_EREAD         An underlying read, seek, or tell operation failed
                              when it should have succeeded.
   \retval #OP_EFAULT        There was a memory allocation failure, or an
                              internal library error.
   \retval #OP_EIMPL         The stream used a feature that is not implemented,
                              such as an unsupported channel family.
   \retval #OP_EINVAL        The stream was not partially opened with
                              op_test_callbacks() or one of the associated
                              convenience functions.
   \retval #OP_ENOTFORMAT    The stream contained a link that did not have any
                              logical Opus streams in it.
   \retval #OP_EBADHEADER    A required header packet was not properly
                              formatted, contained illegal values, or was
                              missing altogether.
   \retval #OP_EVERSION      An ID header contained an unrecognized version
                              number.
   \retval #OP_EBADLINK      We failed to find data we had seen before after
                              seeking.
   \retval #OP_EBADTIMESTAMP The first or last timestamp in a link failed basic
                              validity checks.*/</doc>
