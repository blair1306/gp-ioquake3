  The frequency information must be discernable by the decoder, assuming it
   has read only the previous symbols from the stream.
  It is allowable to change the frequency information, or even the entire
   source alphabet, so long as the decoder can tell from the context of the
   previously encoded information that it is supposed to do so as well.
  _fl: The cumulative frequency of all symbols that come before the one to be
        encoded.
  _fh: The cumulative frequency of all symbols up to and including the one to
        be encoded.
       Together with _fl, this defines the range [_fl,_fh) in which the
        decoded value will fall.
  _ft: The sum of the frequencies of all the symbols*/</doc>
