 * Consume data in advance of what the decompressor requires.
 * This can be called at any time once the decompressor object has
 * been created and a data source has been set up.
 *
 * This routine is essentially a state machine that handles a couple
 * of critical state-transition actions, namely initial setup and
 * transition from header scanning to ready-for-start_decompress.
 * All the actual input is done via the input controller&apos;s consume_input
 * method.
