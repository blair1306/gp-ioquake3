<doc f='codebrowser/code/opus-1.1.4/include/opus_defines.h' l='456'>/** Gets the total samples of delay added by the entire codec.
  * This can be queried by the encoder and then the provided number of samples can be
  * skipped on from the start of the decoder&apos;s output to provide time aligned input
  * and output. From the perspective of a decoding application the real data begins this many
  * samples late.
  *
  * The decoder contribution to this delay is identical for all decoders, but the
  * encoder portion of the delay may vary from implementation to implementation,
  * version to version, or even depend on the encoder&apos;s initial configuration.
  * Applications needing delay compensation should call this CTL rather than
  * hard-coding a value.
