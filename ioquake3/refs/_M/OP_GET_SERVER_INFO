   Very little validation is done.
   In particular, OpusServerInfo::url may not be a valid URL,
    OpusServerInfo::bitrate_kbps may not really be in kbps, and
    OpusServerInfo::content_type may not be a valid MIME type.
   The character set of the string fields is not specified anywhere, and should
    not be assumed to be valid UTF-8.
   \param _info OpusServerInfo *: Returns information about the server.
                                  If there is any error opening the stream, the
                                   contents of this structure remain
                                   unmodified.
                                  On success, fills in the structure with the
                                   server information that was available, if
                                   any.
                                  After a successful return, the contents of
                                   this structure should be freed by calling
                                   opus_server_info_clear().
