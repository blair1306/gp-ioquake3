 *  \brief  A variable controlling whether the window frame and title bar are interactive when the cursor is hidden 
 *
 *  This variable can be set to the following values:
 *    &quot;0&quot;       - The window frame is not interactive when the cursor is hidden (no move, resize, etc)
 *    &quot;1&quot;       - The window frame is interactive when the cursor is hidden
 *
 *  By default SDL will allow interaction with the window frame when the cursor is hidden
