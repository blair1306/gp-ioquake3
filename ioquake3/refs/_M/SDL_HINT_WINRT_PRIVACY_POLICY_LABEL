 *
 *  Network-enabled WinRT apps must include a privacy policy.  On Windows 8, 8.1, and RT,
 *  Microsoft mandates that this policy be available via the Windows Settings charm.
 *  SDL provides code to add a link there, with its label text being set via the
 *  optional hint, SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_LABEL.
 *
 *  Please note that a privacy policy&apos;s contents are not set via this hint.  A separate
 *  hint, SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL, is used to link to the actual text of the
 *  policy.
 *
 *  The contents of this hint should be encoded as a UTF8 string.
 *
 *  The default value is &quot;Privacy Policy&quot;.  This hint should only be set during app
 *  initialization, preferably before any calls to SDL_Init.
 *
 *  For additional information on linking to a privacy policy, see the documentation for
 *  SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL.
