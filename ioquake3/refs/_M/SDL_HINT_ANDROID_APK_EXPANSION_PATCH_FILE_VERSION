 * \brief Android APK expansion patch file version. Should be a string number like &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot; etc.
 *
 * Must be set together with SDL_HINT_ANDROID_APK_EXPANSION_MAIN_FILE_VERSION.
 *
 * If both hints were set then SDL_RWFromFile() will look into expansion files
 * after a given relative path was not found in the internal storage and assets.
 *
 * By default this hint is not set and the APK expansion files are not searched.
