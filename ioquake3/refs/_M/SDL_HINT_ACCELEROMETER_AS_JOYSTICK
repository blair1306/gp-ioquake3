 *  \brief  A variable controlling whether the Android / iOS built-in
 *  accelerometer should be listed as a joystick device, rather than listing
 *  actual joysticks only.
 *
 *  This variable can be set to the following values:
 *    &quot;0&quot;       - List only real joysticks and accept input from them
 *    &quot;1&quot;       - List real joysticks along with the accelerometer as if it were a 3 axis joystick (the default).
