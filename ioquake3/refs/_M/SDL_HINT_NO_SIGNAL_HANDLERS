 *  \brief Tell SDL not to catch the SIGINT or SIGTERM signals.
 *
 * This hint only applies to Unix-like platforms.
 *
 * The variable can be set to the following values:
 *   &quot;0&quot;       - SDL will install a SIGINT and SIGTERM handler, and when it
 *               catches a signal, convert it into an SDL_QUIT event.
 *   &quot;1&quot;       - SDL will not install a signal handler at all.
