 *  \brief A URL to a WinRT app&apos;s privacy policy
 *
 *  All network-enabled WinRT apps must make a privacy policy available to its
 *  users.  On Windows 8, 8.1, and RT, Microsoft mandates that this policy be
 *  be available in the Windows Settings charm, as accessed from within the app.
 *  SDL provides code to add a URL-based link there, which can point to the app&apos;s
 *  privacy policy.
 *
 *  To setup a URL to an app&apos;s privacy policy, set SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL
 *  before calling any SDL_Init functions.  The contents of the hint should
 *  be a valid URL.  For example, &quot;http://www.example.com&quot;.
 *
 *  The default value is &quot;&quot;, which will prevent SDL from adding a privacy policy
 *  link to the Settings charm.  This hint should only be set during app init.
 *
 *  The label text of an app&apos;s &quot;Privacy Policy&quot; link may be customized via another
 *  hint, SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_LABEL.
 *
 *  Please note that on Windows Phone, Microsoft does not provide standard UI
 *  for displaying a privacy policy link, and as such, SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL
 *  will not get used on that platform.  Network-enabled phone apps should display
 *  their privacy policy through some other, in-app means.
