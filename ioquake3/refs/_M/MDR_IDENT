 * Here are the definitions for Ravensoft&apos;s model format of md4. Raven stores their
 * playermodels in .mdr files, in some games, which are pretty much like the md4
 * format implemented by ID soft. It seems like ID&apos;s original md4 stuff is not used at all.
 * MDR is being used in EliteForce, JediKnight2 and Soldiers of Fortune2 (I think).
 * So this comes in handy for anyone who wants to make it possible to load player
 * models from these games.
 * This format has bone tags, which is similar to the thing you have in md3 I suppose.
 * Raven has released their version of md3view under GPL enabling me to add support
 * to this codebase. Thanks to Steven Howes aka Skinner for helping with example
 * source code.
