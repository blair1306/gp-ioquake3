// FIXME: consolidate all of the common stuff in one structure for menus and items
// THINKABOUTME: is there any compelling reason not to have items contain items
// and do away with a menu per say.. major issue is not being able to dynamically allocate 
// and destroy stuff.. Another point to consider is adding an alloc free call for vm&apos;s and have 
// the engine just allocate the pool for it based on a cvar
// many of the vars are re-used for different item types, as such they are not always named appropriately
// the benefits of c++ in DOOM will greatly help crap like this
// FIXME: need to put a type ptr that points to specific type info per type
