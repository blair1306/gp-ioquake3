 *  \brief  A variable controlling whether the X11 _NET_WM_PING protocol should be supported.
 *
 *  This variable can be set to the following values:
 *    &quot;0&quot;       - Disable _NET_WM_PING
 *    &quot;1&quot;       - Enable _NET_WM_PING
 *
 *  By default SDL will use _NET_WM_PING, but for applications that know they
 *  will not always be able to respond to ping requests in a timely manner they can
 *  turn it off to avoid the window manager thinking the app is hung.
 *  The hint is checked in CreateWindow.
