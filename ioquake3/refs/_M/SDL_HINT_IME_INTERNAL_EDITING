 * \brief A variable to control whether certain IMEs should handle text editing internally instead of sending SDL_TEXTEDITING events.
 *
 * The variable can be set to the following values:
 *   &quot;0&quot;       - SDL_TEXTEDITING events are sent, and it is the application&apos;s
 *               responsibility to render the text from these events and 
 *               differentiate it somehow from committed text. (default)
 *   &quot;1&quot;       - If supported by the IME then SDL_TEXTEDITING events are not sent, 
 *               and text that is being composed will be rendered in its own UI.
