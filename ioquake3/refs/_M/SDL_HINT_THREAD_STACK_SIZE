*  \brief  A string specifying SDL&apos;s threads stack size in bytes or &quot;0&quot; for the backend&apos;s default size
*
*  Use this hint in case you need to set SDL&apos;s threads stack size to other than the default.
*  This is specially useful if you build SDL against a non glibc libc library (such as musl) which
*  provides a relatively small default thread stack size (a few kilobytes versus the default 8MB glibc uses).
*  Support for this hint is currently available only in the pthread backend.
