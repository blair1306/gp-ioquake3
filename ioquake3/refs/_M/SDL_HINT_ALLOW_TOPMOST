 *  \brief If set to &quot;0&quot; then never set the top most bit on a SDL Window, even if the video mode expects it.
 *      This is a debugging aid for developers and not expected to be used by end users. The default is &quot;1&quot;
 *
 *  This variable can be set to the following values:
 *    &quot;0&quot;       - don&apos;t allow topmost
 *    &quot;1&quot;       - allow topmost
