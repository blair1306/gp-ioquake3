 *  \brief  A variable controlling whether updates to the SDL screen surface should be synchronized with the vertical refresh, to avoid tearing.
 *
 *  This variable can be set to the following values:
 *    &quot;0&quot;       - Disable vsync
 *    &quot;1&quot;       - Enable vsync
 *
 *  By default SDL does not sync screen surface updates with vertical refresh.
