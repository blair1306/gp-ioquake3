 * \brief A variable to control whether mouse and touch events are to be treated together or separately
 *
 * The variable can be set to the following values:
 *   &quot;0&quot;       - Mouse events will be handled as touch events, and touch will raise fake mouse
 *               events. This is the behaviour of SDL &lt;= 2.0.3. (default)
 *   &quot;1&quot;       - Mouse events will be handled separately from pure touch events.
 *
 * The value of this hint is used at runtime, so it can be changed at any time.
