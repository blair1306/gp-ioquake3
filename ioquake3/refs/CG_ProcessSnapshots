============
CG_ProcessSnapshots

We are trying to set up a renderable view, so determine
what the simulated time is, and try to get snapshots
both before and after that time if available.

If we don&apos;t have a valid cg.snap after exiting this function,
then a 3D game view cannot be rendered.  This should only happen
right after the initial connection.  After cg.snap has been valid
once, it will never turn invalid.

Even if cg.snap is valid, cg.nextSnap may not be, if the snapshot
hasn&apos;t arrived yet (it becomes an extrapolating situation instead
of an interpolating one)
