<doc f='codebrowser/code/opusfile-0.8/include/opusfile.h' l='1787'>/**Sets the packet decode callback function.
   If set, this is called once for each packet that needs to be decoded.
   This can be used by advanced applications to do additional processing on the
    compressed or uncompressed data.
   For example, an application might save the final entropy coder state for
    debugging and testing purposes, or it might apply additional filters
    before the downmixing, dithering, or soft-clipping performed by
    &lt;tt&gt;libopusfile&lt;/tt&gt;, so long as these filters do not introduce any
    latency.

   A call to this function is no guarantee that the audio will eventually be
    delivered to the application.
   &lt;tt&gt;libopusfile&lt;/tt&gt; may discard some or all of the decoded audio data
    (i.e., at the beginning or end of a link, or after a seek), however the
    callback is still required to provide all of it.
   \param _of        The \c OggOpusFile on which to set the decode callback.
   \param _decode_cb The callback function to call.
                     This may be &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; to disable calling the
                      callback.
   \param _ctx       The application-provided context pointer to pass to the
                      callback on each call.*/</doc>
