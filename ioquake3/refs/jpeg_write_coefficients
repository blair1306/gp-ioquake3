 * Compression initialization for writing raw-coefficient data.
 * Before calling this, all parameters and a data destination must be set up.
 * Call jpeg_finish_compress() to actually write the data.
 *
 * The number of passed virtual arrays must match cinfo-&gt;num_components.
 * Note that the virtual arrays need not be filled or even realized at
 * the time write_coefficients is called; indeed, if the virtual arrays
 * were requested from this compression object&apos;s memory manager, they
 * typically will be realized during this routine and filled afterwards.
