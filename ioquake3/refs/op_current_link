<doc f='codebrowser/code/opusfile-0.8/include/opusfile.h' l='1569'>/**Retrieve the index of the current link.
   This is the link that produced the data most recently read by
    op_read_float() or its associated functions, or, after a seek, the link
    that the seek target landed in.
   Reading more data may advance the link index (even on the first read after a
    seek).
   \param _of The \c OggOpusFile from which to retrieve the current link index.
   \return The index of the current link on success, or a negative value on
            failure.
           For seekable streams, this is a number between 0 and the value
            returned by op_link_count().
           For unseekable streams, this value starts at 0 and increments by one
            each time a new link is encountered (even though op_link_count()
            always returns 1).
   \retval #OP_EINVAL The stream was only partially open.*/</doc>
