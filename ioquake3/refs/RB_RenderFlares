==================
RB_RenderFlares

Because flares are simulating an occular effect, they should be drawn after
everything (all views) in the entire frame has been drawn.

Because of the way portals use the depth buffer to mark off areas, the
needed information would be lost after each view, so we are forced to draw
flares after each view.

The resulting artifact is that flares in mirrors or portals don&apos;t dim properly
when occluded by something in the main view, and portal flares that should
extend past the portal edge will be overwritten.
