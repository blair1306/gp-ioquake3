A global sound will play full volume throughout the level.
Activator sounds will play on the player that activated the target.
Global and activator sounds can&apos;t be combined with looping.
Normal sounds play each time the target is used.
Looped sounds will be toggled by use functions.
Multiple identical looping sounds will just increase volume without any speed cost.
